## Objective

As a regional manager responsible for overseeing a chain of car dealerships, my objective is to develop visualizations that provide comprehensive insights into the car sales and profits of each dealer. These visualizations will enable me to gain a better understanding of the performance and financial aspects of the dealerships under my supervision.
